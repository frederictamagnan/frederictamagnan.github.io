I am currently finishing my Master of Engineering at IMT Atlantique, France, with specializations in Machine Learning and general Artificial Intelligence, I am looking for a first experience in academic research to prepare a Ph.D application in the same field.

I am looking for a 6-month research internship starting between september and october 2018. I would like to strengthen my knowledge of deep learning to prepare my application. Iâ€™m interested in various fields : from music information processing to annotating object instances by self-driving cars.

 However, I would be interested in being supervised on a personal topic about Deep Reinforcement Learning applied to sound design. I developed it in an attached powerpoint.
I also get a Master of Science in Management from Grenoble Ecole de Management, France.
