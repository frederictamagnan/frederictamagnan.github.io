On-line communities are a pillar of the web and represent a huge part of the Internet traffic.
The importance of on-line communities have risen in popularity, since they have become one of the most crucial part of the modern companies marketing strategy. In fact, in digital marketing client relationship management is fundamental to the success of companies. Hence, ensuring the development and the flourishing of these communities is a concern of community managers and owners. The real issue is that monitoring technics are still empirical. In fact, community managers still use simple indicators such as the frequency and the number of messages exchanged as well as the development of the number of participants. What companies need are tools that allows them to follow the dynamic of interactions within the community, and help them understand the real causes behind the tendencies within their own network. These tools have to deal with a much more complex context since these communities are different from social media where people clearly state their relations with other people. It is complicated to identify the tendency of interaction based only on empirical indicators, thus the new methods of analysis must automatically detect and qualify the interaction of interactions where participants share the same subject on a forum or co-fund the same project.On-line communities are a pillar of the web and represent a huge part of the Internet traffic.
